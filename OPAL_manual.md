## Introduction

### What is OPAL?

OPAL (Operations, Procedures, Assets, Logistics) is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system specifically designed for small teams working on hardware projects that require rigorous traceability and quality control. Unlike traditional ERP systems that are complex, cloud-based, and expensive, OPAL is:

- **Local-first**: Runs entirely on a single computer (typically a laptop)
- **Network-accessible**: Other team members can access it on the local network
- **Simple yet rigorous**: Provides aerospace-level traceability without enterprise complexity
- **Hardware-focused**: Optimized for physical parts, assemblies, and manufacturing procedures
- **Audit-ready**: Every action is logged with full traceability

### Who Should Use OPAL?

OPAL is ideal for:

- Small hardware startups (2-20 people)
- Research labs building physical prototypes
- Hardware projects requiring documentation and traceability
- Teams that need to track parts, assemblies, and manufacturing procedures
- Projects with compliance requirements but limited budget
- Makerspaces and educational institutions teaching hardware development

### Key Features at a Glance

## Getting Started

### Installation

There are two ways to install OPAL:

1. **Standalone binary** (recommended for most users) — download a single file and run it
2. **From source** (for development) — clone the repo and install with `uv`

#### Option A: Standalone Binary

Install with a single command:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amorphous-engineering/OPAL/master/install.sh | sh
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amorphous-engineering/OPAL/master/install.ps1 | iex
```

Or download manually from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/amorphous-engineering/OPAL/releases/latest) page:

| Platform | File |
|----------|------|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `opal-macos-arm64` |
| macOS (Intel) | `opal-macos-x86_64` |
| Linux (x86_64) | `opal-linux-x86_64` |
| Windows (x86_64) | `opal-windows-x86_64.exe` |

On macOS/Linux, make it executable and run:

```bash
chmod +x opal-macos-arm64
./opal-macos-arm64
```

On Windows, double-click `opal-windows-x86_64.exe`.

The launcher handles everything: database initialization, migrations, and server management. See [Desktop App](#desktop-app) for full details.

#### Option B: From Source (Development)

##### Prerequisites

- A computer running macOS, Linux, or Windows
- Python 3.11 or higher (installed automatically by uv)
- ~100 MB disk space for software
- Additional space for data and attachments

##### Step 1: Install uv

OPAL uses `uv` for Python dependency management. Install it:

```bash
# macOS and Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

##### Step 2: Download OPAL

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amorphous-engineering/OPAL.git
cd OPAL
```

##### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

This installs all required Python packages.

##### Step 4: Initialize Database

```bash
uv run opal init
```

This creates the SQLite database at `./data/opal.db` and runs all migrations.

##### Step 5: Start the Server

```bash
uv run opal serve
```

By default, OPAL runs on `http://localhost:8080`. The server will print the URL when it starts.

##### Step 6: Access the Web Interface

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You should see the OPAL dashboard.

### Initial Setup

#### Project Configuration

On first run, OPAL will prompt you to configure your project:

1. **Project Name**: Your organization or project name
2. **Tier Definitions**: Classification system for parts (default: Flight, Ground, Loose)
3. **Location Setup**: Physical storage locations (e.g., "Warehouse", "Lab Bench", "Cabinet A")

This creates a `opal.project.yaml` file with your settings.

#### Create Users

Navigate to **Users** and create user accounts for your team members. While OPAL doesn't have authentication yet, user tracking is essential for:

- Audit logs
- Procedure execution sign-offs
- Responsibility assignment

Create at least one user for yourself.

#### Select Your User

In the upper-right corner of the interface, click the user dropdown (shows "NO USER" initially) and select your username. This selection persists in your browser and is used for all actions.

### Optional: Seed Demo Data

To explore OPAL with sample data:

```bash
uv run opal seed
```

This creates example parts, procedures, and other entities.

---

## Desktop App

The OPAL desktop app is a standalone binary that bundles everything needed to run OPAL — no Python installation, no dependency management, no terminal commands. It provides a TUI (terminal user interface) launcher for managing the OPAL server.

### First Launch

On first launch the desktop app:

1. Creates the platform data directory (see [Data Directory](#data-directory) below)
2. Initializes the SQLite database and runs all migrations
3. Presents the launcher interface

No manual setup is required.

### Launcher Interface

The launcher displays:

- **Server Panel** — current server status (STOPPED / STARTING / RUNNING), port, URL, and data directory path
- **Controls** — Start, Stop, Restart, and Open in Browser buttons
- **Log** — timestamped output from the server process and launcher events
- **Footer** — version number, Check for Updates button, Quit button

### Keyboard Shortcuts

All launcher actions are accessible via keyboard:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `s` | Start server |
| `x` | Stop server |
| `r` | Restart server |
| `o` | Open web UI in browser |
| `u` | Check for updates (or install pending update) |
| `q` | Quit (stops server first) |

### Data Directory

The standalone binary stores its database and attachments in a platform-specific data directory:

| Platform | Default Path |
|----------|-------------|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/OPAL/` |
| Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opal/` (default `~/.local/share/opal/`) |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OPAL\` |

To override the data directory, set the `OPAL_DATA_DIR` environment variable:

```bash
OPAL_DATA_DIR=/path/to/custom/data ./opal
```

The data directory contains:

- `opal.db` — SQLite database
- `attachments/` — uploaded files

### Updating

The launcher can check for updates from GitHub Releases:

1. Press `u` (or click **Check for Updates**)
2. If an update is available, the log shows the new version and release notes
3. For binary installs, press `u` again to download and install the update
4. Restart the app to apply the update

The updater detects the correct binary for your platform automatically.

### Running Headless (Server-Only)

The desktop app is not required for server operation. For CI, server deployments, or users who prefer the terminal:

```bash
# From source
uv run opal serve

# Or with the binary's Python (development install)
opal-app  # launches the TUI
opal serve  # runs the server directly
```

The web UI is fully functional without the launcher.

## Core Concepts

### The OPAL Philosophy

OPAL is built around several key principles:

1. **Unique Identifiers**: Every physical item gets a unique OPAL number that never changes
2. **Version Control**: Procedures are versioned; executions lock to specific versions
3. **Explicit State**: Everything has a clear status visible in the UI
4. **Complete History**: All changes are logged and queryable
5. **Simple but Rigorous**: Easy to use, but maintains compliance-grade traceability

### Key Terminology

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Part** | A design-level definition of a component | "Li-Ion Battery 18650" |
| **Inventory Record** | A physical instance or batch of a part | OPAL-00042 (10 units of that battery) |
| **OPAL Number** | Unique identifier for inventory items | OPAL-00001, OPAL-00042 |
| **Internal PN** | OPAL-generated part number | FL/1-001, GR/2-012 |
| **External PN** | Manufacturer or supplier part number | NCR18650B |
| **Master Procedure** | Living template for a manufacturing process | "Battery Module Assembly v3" |
| **Procedure Version** | Immutable snapshot of a procedure | Version 2 (published 2024-01-15) |
| **Procedure Instance** | A single execution of a procedure version | WO-0023 |
| **Work Order (WO)** | Unique identifier for procedure instances | WO-0001, WO-0023 |
| **Step Execution** | Completion of one step in an instance | Step 3.2 in WO-0023 |
| **Kit** | Bill of materials for a procedure | "Requires 12× FL/1-001, 1× FL/1-002" |
| **Non-Conformance (NC)** | Deviation from procedure or specification | "Battery polarity reversed" |
| **Issue Ticket** | Tracked problem or task | IT-0005 |
| **Risk Ticket** | Identified risk requiring mitigation | RISK-0003 |
| **Tier** | Classification level for parts | Flight (1), Ground (2), Loose (3) |
| **Genealogy** | Parent-child relationships in assemblies | "Which batteries are in this module?" |

## Parts & Inventory Management

### Parts Database

#### What is a Part?

A **Part** in OPAL represents a design-level component - the abstract definition of something you use in your project. It's **not** a physical item; it's the blueprint or specification.

**Example**:
- Part: "Samsung 18650 Li-Ion Battery, 3400mAh"
- Inventory: OPAL-00042 (10 of those batteries sitting on Shelf A)

#### Creating a Part

1. Navigate to **Inventory → Parts** in the navigation menu dropdown
2. Click **New Part**
3. Fill in the form:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Yes | Human-readable name (e.g., "Li-Ion Battery 18650") |
| **Internal PN** | Auto | Auto-generated based on tier (can override) |
| **External PN** | No | Manufacturer part number (e.g., "NCR18650B") |
| **Category** | No | Grouping (e.g., "Batteries", "Fasteners", "PCBs") |
| **Tier** | Yes | Classification level (Flight/Ground/Loose) |
| **Unit of Measure** | Yes | How it's counted (each, kg, m, L, etc.) |
| **Description** | No | Detailed specifications |
| **Parent Part** | No | For assemblies - what this is part of |
| **Tracking Type** | Yes | BULK (counted by quantity) or SERIALIZED (each item tracked) |
| **Metadata** | No | Custom JSON fields for extra data |

4. Click **Create Part**

#### Part Number Schemes

OPAL auto-generates internal part numbers in the format: `TIER_CODE/TIER_NUMBER-SEQUENCE`

**Default Tiers:**
- `FL/1-###`: Flight-critical parts (tier 1)
- `GR/2-###`: Ground support equipment (tier 2)
- `LO/3-###`: Loose parts / commercial off-the-shelf (tier 3)

These can be customized in `opal.project.yaml`.

**Why two part numbers?**
- **Internal PN**: Your numbering system, controlled by you
- **External PN**: Manufacturer's number for ordering and cross-referencing

#### Part Categories

Categories are free-form tags for grouping parts. Common examples:

- Batteries
- Fasteners (Bolts, Nuts, Washers)
- Electronics (ICs, Resistors, Capacitors)
- Mechanical (Brackets, Shafts, Bearings)
- PCBAs (Printed Circuit Board Assemblies)
- Consumables (Solder, Epoxy, Kapton Tape)
- Tools (Torque Wrenches, Calipers)

#### Tracking Types

**BULK**: Used for parts tracked by quantity only
- Example: Fasteners, resistors, consumables
- Inventory shows total count at each location
- Consumed by quantity

**SERIALIZED**: Used for parts where each individual item must be tracked
- Example: Expensive batteries, critical components, assemblies
- Each inventory record is one item with a unique OPAL number
- Consumed one at a time with full traceability

#### Searching and Filtering Parts

The parts list supports:

- **Text search**: Searches name, internal PN, external PN, description
- **Category filter**: Show only parts in specific category
- **Tier filter**: Show only Flight/Ground/Loose parts
- **Parent filter**: Show only top-level parts or sub-assemblies

### Inventory Records

#### What is an Inventory Record?

An **Inventory Record** represents physical items in your possession. Each record has:

- A unique **OPAL number** (never reused)
- A **quantity** (1 for serialized items, any number for bulk)
- A **location** (where it's physically stored)
- A **part reference** (what design it implements)
- A **source** (where it came from)

#### Creating Inventory Records

There are three ways to create inventory:

1. **Manual Entry** (for existing stock or donations)
2. **Purchase Receiving** (when POs arrive)
3. **Production** (when procedures create assemblies)

##### Method 1: Manual Entry

1. Navigate to **Inventory → Stock Levels**
2. Click **New Inventory Record**
3. Fill in:
   - **Part**: Select from dropdown
   - **Quantity**: How many units
   - **Location**: Where it's stored
   - **Lot Number**: Optional batch/lot code
   - **Notes**: Optional context

4. Click **Create**

The system auto-generates an OPAL number (e.g., OPAL-00001).

##### Method 2: Receiving a Purchase Order

(See [Procurement → Receiving](#receiving-purchases) for detailed workflow)

When you receive a PO, OPAL automatically creates inventory records with OPAL numbers linked to the purchase.

##### Method 3: Production

(See [Procedures → Production](#producing-assemblies) for detailed workflow)

When a BUILD procedure completes, it creates inventory records for the assembled products.

#### OPAL Numbers

OPAL numbers are the backbone of traceability:

- Format: `OPAL-#####` (e.g., OPAL-00001, OPAL-00234)
- Sequential, never reused
- Survive transfers, adjustments, and partial consumptions
- Can be printed as labels or barcodes

**Best Practice**: Print OPAL number labels and affix them to bins, bags, or individual items.

#### Locations

Locations are free-form text fields representing physical storage:

- Warehouse Shelf A
- Lab Bench 3
- Cabinet B, Drawer 2
- Cold Storage
- Receiving Area
- Scrap Bin

**Tip**: Use consistent naming and consider a hierarchical scheme:
- `BLDG-A > ROOM-101 > SHELF-3 > BIN-A`

#### Lot Numbers

Lot numbers (also called batch numbers) track groups of parts received together:

- Provided by supplier or manufacturer
- Important for tracking defects or recalls
- Optional but recommended for critical parts

**Example**: You receive 100 batteries from supplier with lot code "LOT-2024-Q1-003". If one fails, you can identify all parts from the same lot.

#### Adjusting Inventory

To change the quantity of an existing inventory record:

1. Go to the inventory record detail page
2. Click **Adjust Quantity**
3. Enter:
   - **New Quantity**: Target amount (not delta)
   - **Reason**: Why (e.g., "Found 2 more in drawer", "Damaged in handling")
4. Click **Adjust**

The system logs the old quantity, new quantity, reason, user, and timestamp.

#### Performing Physical Counts

Physical counts verify actual inventory matches system records:

1. Go to the inventory record detail page
2. Click **Perform Count**
3. Enter:
   - **Counted Quantity**: What you physically counted
   - **Notes**: Optional observations
4. Click **Record Count**

If the counted quantity differs from the system quantity, OPAL:
- Highlights the discrepancy
- Logs the variance
- Prompts you to adjust the quantity

**Best Practice**: Perform regular cycle counts (e.g., weekly) on critical items.

#### Transferring Between Locations

To move inventory:

1. Go to the inventory record detail page
2. Click **Transfer**
3. Enter:
   - **To Location**: Destination
   - **Quantity**: How much to move (or all)
   - **Reason**: Why (e.g., "Moving to workbench for assembly")
4. Click **Transfer**

For partial transfers, OPAL creates a new inventory record at the destination with a new OPAL number, and reduces the source quantity.

#### Viewing Inventory History

Every inventory record has a complete history showing:

- **Created**: When and how (manual/purchase/production)
- **Adjusted**: Quantity changes with reasons
- **Counted**: Physical count results
- **Transferred**: Movements between locations
- **Consumed**: When used in procedures
- **Tested**: Test results (pass/fail)

Access history on the inventory detail page.

### Bill of Materials (BOM)

#### Design-Level BOM

The BOM defines the design-level structure of assemblies:

**Example**:
```
Battery Module (FL/1-005)
├── 12× Li-Ion Cell 18650 (FL/1-001)
├── 1× BMS PCB (FL/1-002)
├── 1× Nickel Strip, 1m (LO/3-045)
└── 4× M3×10 Bolt (LO/3-001)
```

#### Creating a BOM

1. Navigate to the **assembly part** (parent)
2. Go to the **BOM** tab
3. Click **Add Component**
4. Select:
   - **Component Part**: Child part
   - **Quantity**: How many per assembly
   - **Reference Designators**: Optional (e.g., "U1, U2, U3" for ICs)
5. Click **Add**

#### Reference Designators

Reference designators identify specific instances of components in the assembly:

**Example**: A PCB assembly might have:
- Part: "0.1µF Capacitor"
- Quantity: 5
- Designators: "C1, C2, C3, C4, C5"

This is critical for troubleshooting: "Replace C3" is much clearer than "Replace one of the five capacitors."

#### Viewing Where-Used

The **Where-Used** query shows all assemblies that contain a given part:

1. Go to a part detail page
2. Click **Where-Used** tab

**Example**: For "M3×10 Bolt", you might see:
- Battery Module (4 per assembly)
- Avionics Enclosure (16 per assembly)
- Test Fixture (8 per assembly)

This is essential for impact analysis: "If we change this bolt, which assemblies are affected?"

### Inventory Testing

#### Test Templates

Test templates define quality checks that should be performed on inventory items:

**Types of Tests:**

1. **Boolean**: Pass/fail check
   - Example: "Visual inspection - no damage"

2. **Numeric**: Measured value with optional min/max limits
   - Example: "Voltage test: 3.6-3.8V expected"

3. **Text**: Free-form result
   - Example: "Serial number: _______"

#### Creating Test Templates

1. Go to a part detail page
2. Click **Test Templates** tab
3. Click **New Template**
4. Fill in:
   - **Name**: What is being tested
   - **Type**: Boolean / Numeric / Text
   - **Required**: Must this test pass for item to be usable?
   - **Min/Max**: For numeric tests, acceptable range
   - **Instructions**: How to perform the test
5. Click **Create**

#### Performing Tests

1. Go to an inventory record detail page
2. Click **Tests** tab
3. Click **Perform Test**
4. Select the test template
5. Enter the result:
   - Boolean: Pass / Fail
   - Numeric: Measured value (system auto-checks if in range)
   - Text: Free-form entry
6. Add notes if needed
7. Click **Record Test**

#### Viewing Test Status

Each inventory record shows its overall test status:

- **PASS**: All required tests passed
- **FAIL**: One or more required tests failed
- **PENDING**: Required tests not yet performed

Failed items should be quarantined and investigated.

## Procedures & Execution

### Master Procedures

#### What is a Master Procedure?

A **Master Procedure** is a living document that defines how to build or test something. It contains:

- Hierarchical steps with instructions
- Data capture requirements
- Part requirements (kit)
- Expected outputs
- Contingency steps

Master procedures are editable and evolve over time. When ready for production use, you **publish** them to create an immutable **version**.

#### Procedure Types

OPAL supports two types:

1. **OP (Operating Procedure)**: General procedures (assembly, testing, calibration)
2. **BUILD**: Procedures that produce trackable assemblies with OPAL numbers

#### Creating a Master Procedure

1. Navigate to **Manufacturing → Procedures**
2. Click **New Procedure**
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: Clear, descriptive name
   - **Type**: OP or BUILD
   - **Description**: Overview and purpose
   - **Status**: DRAFT (initial), ACTIVE (ready for use), DEPRECATED (obsolete)
4. Click **Create**

You now have an empty procedure. Next, add steps.

#### Adding Steps

Steps can be flat or hierarchical:

**Flat Structure:**
```
1. Prepare workspace
2. Gather materials
3. Assemble parts
4. Perform quality check
5. Package and label
```

**Hierarchical Structure:**
```
1. Prepare workspace
   1.1. Clean bench
   1.2. Gather tools
   1.3. Put on ESD protection
2. Cell preparation

   2.2. Test voltage on each cell
   2.3. Mark polarity
3. Assembly
   3.1. Install cells in holder
   3.2. Connect BMS
   3.3. Apply insulation
```

##### Adding a Step

1. On the procedure detail page, click **Add Step**
2. Fill in:
   - **Parent Step**: Leave empty for top-level, or select parent for sub-step
   - **Title**: Short name
   - **Instructions**: Detailed markdown instructions
   - **Is Contingency**: Check if this is a contingency step (only required if an NC occurs)
   - **Required Data Schema**: JSON schema for data capture (see below)
3. Click **Add**

OPAL auto-numbers steps: 1, 2, 3 for top-level; 1.1, 1.2 for sub-steps; C1, C2 for contingencies.

##### Reordering Steps

Use the **Reorder Steps** button to drag-and-drop steps into the correct sequence.

#### Step Instructions (Markdown)

Instructions support **Markdown** formatting:

```markdown
## Cell Voltage Test

1. Use a calibrated multimeter (±0.01V accuracy)
2. Measure voltage across **positive and negative terminals**
3. Record value in data capture field below

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Voltage must be between 3.6V and 3.8V
- If out of range, log NC and move to contingency step C1

![Measurement diagram](https://example.com/diagram.png)
```

Supported features:
- Headers, lists, bold, italic
- Links and images
- Code blocks
- Tables

#### Data Capture Schemas

Steps can require operators to capture data. Define what's needed using a JSON schema:

**Example: Numeric Measurement**
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "voltage": {
      "type": "number",
      "minimum": 3.6,
      "maximum": 3.8,
      "description": "Cell voltage in volts"
    }
  },
  "required": ["voltage"]
}
```

**Example: Multiple Fields**
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "visual_inspection": {
      "type": "boolean",
      "description": "No visible damage or defects"
    },
    "serial_number": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Cell serial number from label"
    },
    "notes": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Additional observations"
    }
  },
  "required": ["visual_inspection", "serial_number"]
}
```

During execution, OPAL auto-generates a form based on this schema.

#### Contingency Steps

Contingency steps handle non-conformances:

**Example**:
```
3. Test voltage
C1. [Contingency] Low voltage cell recovery
   C1.1. Charge cell at 0.1C for 1 hour
   C1.2. Re-test voltage
   C1.3. If still low, quarantine cell and log NC
```

Contingency steps:
- Are numbered C1, C2, C3...
- Only appear during execution if explicitly started
- Are required if started (cannot skip)
- Often created when an NC is logged

#### Procedure Kits

The **Kit** defines which parts are consumed by the procedure:

1. On the procedure detail page, click **Kit** tab
2. Click **Add Kit Item**
3. Select:
   - **Part**: Which part is consumed
   - **Quantity**: How many per execution
   - **Notes**: Optional context
4. Click **Add**

**Example Kit for "Battery Module Assembly":**
- 12× FL/1-001 (Li-Ion Cell 18650)
- 1× FL/1-002 (BMS PCB)
- 1× LO/3-045 (Nickel Strip, 1m)
- 4× LO/3-001 (M3×10 Bolt)

During execution, OPAL checks kit availability before allowing the procedure to proceed.

#### Step-Level Kits

Some parts are only needed at specific steps (e.g., tooling that's returned):

1. On the procedure detail page, expand a step
2. Click **Step Kit**
3. Add parts with quantities
4. Mark as **Tooling** if the part is reusable (not permanently consumed)

**Example**: Step "2.3. Apply epoxy" might require:
- 1× LO/3-067 (Syringe)
- 5× LO/3-068 (Mixing stick)

The syringe is tooling (returned after use), mixing sticks are consumed.

#### Procedure Outputs

For **BUILD** type procedures, define what assemblies are produced:

1. On the procedure detail page, click **Outputs** tab
2. Click **Add Output**
3. Select:
   - **Part**: Which assembly is produced (must be a part in your system)
   - **Quantity Per Execution**: How many are created each time
4. Click **Add**

**Example**: "Battery Module Assembly" produces:
- 1× FL/1-005 (Battery Module, 12S1P)

During execution, completing the procedure creates inventory records for the outputs with new OPAL numbers.

#### Publishing Versions

When a master procedure is ready for production:

1. Click **Publish Version**
2. Add **Release Notes** (what changed)
3. Click **Publish**

This creates an immutable **ProcedureVersion** snapshot containing:
- All step content at this moment
- Kit definitions
- Outputs
- Version number (auto-incremented)

### Procedure Instances (Executions)

#### What is a Procedure Instance?

A **Procedure Instance** is a single execution of a specific procedure version. It has:

- A unique **Work Order (WO) number**
- A locked **version reference** (never changes)
- A **status** (PENDING → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED / ABORTED)
- **Step executions** (one for each step in the version)
- **Consumptions** (parts used)
- **Productions** (assemblies created)
- **Participants** (users involved)

#### Creating an Instance

1. Navigate to **Manufacturing → Executions**
2. Click **New Execution**
3. Select:
   - **Procedure**: Which master procedure
   - **Version**: Which published version to execute
   - **Work Order Number**: Auto-generated (WO-0001) or custom
   - **Scheduled Start**: Optional start date/time
   - **Target Completion**: Optional deadline
   - **Priority**: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL
4. Click **Create**

The system:
- Creates the instance with status PENDING
- Generates step executions for all steps in the version
- Checks kit availability
- Displays the execution detail page

#### The Execution Dashboard

The execution detail page shows:

**Header:**
- Work Order number
- Procedure name and version
- Status with color coding
- Progress bar (steps completed / total)

**Step List:**
```
☑ 1. Prepare workspace [SIGNED_OFF] - 00:05:23
  ☑ 1.1. Clean bench [COMPLETED] - 00:02:10
  ☑ 1.2. Gather tools [COMPLETED] - 00:03:13

- View History

#### Executing Steps

##### Basic Flow

1. **Start Step**: Click "Start" on the next pending step
   - Status changes to IN_PROGRESS
   - Timer begins
   - Instructions displayed

2. **Follow Instructions**: Read and perform the step

3. **Capture Data**: Fill in any required fields (measurements, checkboxes, etc.)

4. **Upload Attachments**: Add photos, documents as needed

5. **Complete Step**: Click "Complete"
   - Data is validated against schema
   - Status changes to COMPLETED
   - Timer stops
   - Duration recorded

##### Hierarchical Steps

For **parent OPs** (e.g., step 1 with sub-steps 1.1, 1.2):

1. Start the parent step (step 1)
2. Complete all sub-steps (1.1, 1.2)
3. Parent step status becomes AWAITING_SIGNOFF
4. Click **Sign Off** on the parent step
5. Parent step status becomes SIGNED_OFF

This workflow ensures proper review: the parent OP is checked before moving on.

##### Skipping Steps

Sometimes a step doesn't apply:

1. Click **Skip** on the step
2. Enter a **reason** (required)
3. Click **Confirm Skip**

Skipped steps show as SKIPPED with the reason logged.

**Note**: You cannot skip required steps if they have dependent logic.

#### Data Capture

When a step has a data capture schema, OPAL presents a form:

**Example: Voltage Test**
```
Step 2.2: Test voltage

Instructions:
- Use calibrated multimeter
- Measure voltage across terminals
- Record value below

[Form]
Voltage (V): [____] (must be 3.6-3.8)

[Photo of measurement]: [Upload]

Notes: [_______________]

[Complete Step]
```

Captured data is stored as structured JSON:
```json
{
  "voltage": 3.72,
  "notes": "Cell slightly warm to touch"
}
```

This data is queryable for analysis and reports.

#### Logging Non-Conformances

If something goes wrong:

1. Click **Log Non-Conformance** (available at any step)
2. Fill in:
   - **Step**: Where the NC occurred
   - **Description**: What went wrong
   - **Severity**: MINOR / MAJOR / CRITICAL
3. Click **Log NC**

OPAL automatically:
- Creates an **Issue** ticket (type: NON_CONFORMANCE)
- Links it to the instance and step
- Makes contingency steps available (if defined)

**Example**: "Battery voltage out of spec at step 2.2" creates issue IT-0012 linked to WO-0023, step 2.2.

The NC doesn't stop execution - you can continue or use contingency procedures.

#### Consuming Parts (Kit)

Before or during execution, consume the required parts:

##### Procedure-Level Consumption

1. Click **Consume Parts** (top-level action)
2. The kit list shows required parts with availability
3. For each part, select which inventory record to consume:
   - OPAL number
   - Location
   - Available quantity
4. Click **Consume**

OPAL:
- Reduces inventory quantities (or deletes if fully consumed)
- Records consumption with instance, part, OPAL number, user, timestamp
- Updates kit status

##### Step-Level Consumption

Some parts are consumed at specific steps:

1. Start the step
2. Click **Consume Step Kit**
3. Select inventory records
4. Mark if **Tooling** (reusable)
5. Click **Consume**

Tooling items:
- Are tracked but not permanently consumed
- Can be returned after the step
- Build genealogy (components → assembly) without being used up

**Example**: Using a test fixture:
- Consume: 1× Test Fixture (tooling) at step 3.1
- Complete step 3.1
- Fixture is still available for the next execution

#### Producing Assemblies

For **BUILD** procedures, create the output assemblies:

1. Click **Produce Outputs**
2. The system shows expected outputs from the procedure definition
3. For each output:
   - Confirm quantity
   - Enter location for storage
   - Add serial number or notes
4. Click **Produce**

OPAL:
- Creates new inventory records with new OPAL numbers
- Links to the procedure instance (WO number)
- Records genealogy (which components went into this assembly)
- Sets source as PRODUCTION

**Example**: Completing "Battery Module Assembly" (WO-0023) produces:
- OPAL-00145 (Battery Module, 12S1P) at "Lab Shelf A"

The genealogy links:
- OPAL-00145 (assembly) ← WO-0023 ← consumed parts (OPAL-00031 through OPAL-00042)

#### Viewing Genealogy

On the assembly's inventory detail page, see:

**Forward Genealogy** (what's in this assembly):
```
OPAL-00145 (Battery Module) contains:
- OPAL-00031 (Li-Ion Cell)
- OPAL-00032 (Li-Ion Cell)
- ...
- OPAL-00042 (Li-Ion Cell)
- OPAL-00043 (BMS PCB)
```

**Reverse Genealogy** (where is this component used):
```
OPAL-00031 (Li-Ion Cell) used in:
- OPAL-00145 (Battery Module) via WO-0023
```

This provides complete traceability: if a cell is defective, you know exactly which assemblies contain it.

#### Multi-User Collaboration

Multiple users can work on the same instance:

1. Open the instance detail page
2. Click **Join Execution**
3. Your user is added to participants list
4. Other participants see you as active (real-time via SSE)

**Use cases**:
- Two people working together on assembly
- Supervisor overseeing operator
- Inspector performing sign-offs

When done, click **Leave Execution**.

#### Completing an Instance

An instance is automatically marked COMPLETED when:
- All required steps are completed or signed off
- All contingency steps (if started) are completed
- No steps are IN_PROGRESS

You can also manually abort an instance:
1. Click **Abort Instance**
2. Enter reason
3. Confirm

Aborted instances are preserved for auditing.

## Onshape Integration

### Overview

OPAL integrates with [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/) CAD for bidirectional BOM and metadata synchronization. This allows hardware teams to keep their CAD models and ERP system in lockstep without manual data entry.

**Key behaviors:**

- **Off by default** — zero overhead unless credentials are configured. No background tasks, no API calls, no extra UI elements.
- **Bidirectional sync** — Pull BOM structure and part names from Onshape into OPAL. Push OPAL part numbers and metadata back to Onshape custom properties.
- **Data ownership** — Onshape owns part names, descriptions, and BOM structure. OPAL owns internal part numbers, inventory, tiers, and categories.
- **Change detection** — SHA-256 hashes of synced fields prevent redundant API calls. Only changed parts are synced.
- **Audit trail** — Every sync operation is logged with counters, timestamps, and error details.

### Setup

#### 1. Generate Onshape API Keys

1. Log in to [Onshape Developer Portal](https://dev-portal.onshape.com/)
2. Navigate to **API Keys**
3. Click **Create New API Key**
4. Copy the **Access Key** and **Secret Key** — the secret is shown only once

#### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables before starting OPAL:

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OPAL_ONSHAPE_ACCESS_KEY` | Yes | `""` | Onshape API access key |
| `OPAL_ONSHAPE_SECRET_KEY` | Yes | `""` | Onshape API secret key |
| `OPAL_ONSHAPE_BASE_URL` | No | `https://cad.onshape.com` | Onshape API base URL (change for enterprise instances) |
| `OPAL_ONSHAPE_POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | No | `15` | Minutes between automatic pull syncs (0 to disable polling) |
| `OPAL_ONSHAPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | No | `""` | Shared secret for webhook HMAC-SHA256 verification |

Example:

```bash
export OPAL_ONSHAPE_ACCESS_KEY="your-access-key"
export OPAL_ONSHAPE_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
export OPAL_ONSHAPE_POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES=15
```

The integration activates when both `OPAL_ONSHAPE_ACCESS_KEY` and `OPAL_ONSHAPE_SECRET_KEY` are non-empty.

#### 3. Register Documents in opal.project.yaml

Add an `onshape` section to your project configuration file:

```yaml
onshape:
  documents:
    - name: "Main Assembly"
      document_id: "abc123def456"
      workspace_id: "ws789ghi"
      element_id: "elem012jkl"
      element_type: "assembly"      # Default — syncs BOM hierarchy
      auto_sync: true

    - name: "Machined Parts"
      document_id: "xyz999uvw111"
      workspace_id: ""              # Auto-detected on first sync
      element_id: "elem222mno"
      element_type: "part_studio"   # Flat parts list, no BOM hierarchy
      auto_sync: false              # Manual sync only

  field_mapping:
    internal_pn: "Part Number"      # OPAL field → Onshape custom property name
    category: "Category"
    tier: "Tier"

  default_tier: 1                   # Tier assigned to newly synced parts
  default_category: "structures"    # Category assigned to newly synced parts
```

**Field reference:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `documents` | List of Onshape documents to sync with |
| `documents[].name` | Human-readable label (shown in Settings UI) |
| `documents[].document_id` | Onshape document ID (from the URL: `/documents/{document_id}/...`) |
| `documents[].workspace_id` | Workspace ID (leave empty to auto-detect default workspace) |
| `documents[].element_id` | Element ID of the assembly or part studio to sync |
| `documents[].element_type` | `"assembly"` (default) or `"part_studio"` — determines which Onshape API is used |
| `documents[].auto_sync` | Include this document in automatic polling syncs |
| `field_mapping` | Maps OPAL field names to Onshape custom property names |
| `default_tier` | Tier level assigned to parts created by pull sync |
| `default_category` | Category assigned to parts created by pull sync |

To find document, workspace, and element IDs, open the Onshape document in your browser. The URL has the format:
```
https://cad.onshape.com/documents/{document_id}/w/{workspace_id}/e/{element_id}
```

### Sync Workflows

#### Pull Sync (Onshape → OPAL)

Pull sync fetches BOM structure and part metadata from Onshape and creates or updates OPAL parts.

**What happens:**

1. Fetches the BOM and parts list from the Onshape API
2. For each part in the BOM:
   - Computes a `pull_hash` (SHA-256 of name, description, part number)
   - If the part is new: creates an OPAL Part with an auto-assigned `internal_pn`, creates an OnshapeLink record
   - If the part exists and the hash changed: updates the part name and description
   - If the hash matches: skips (no changes)
3. Syncs BOM structure: creates, updates, or removes BOM lines for parent-child relationships
4. Marks links as **stale** for parts no longer present in the Onshape BOM
5. If new parts were created, automatically runs a push sync to write part numbers back to Onshape

**Assembly root part:** For assembly BOM syncs, a root assembly Part is created to serve as the top-level BOM parent. All top-level components in the Onshape assembly become BOM children of this root part.

**Standard content filtering:** Standard library parts from Onshape (e.g., fasteners, bearings, and other catalog components) are automatically skipped during pull sync. Only custom parts are imported.

**Name-based deduplication:** When the same physical part appears in multiple Part Studios or sub-assemblies, OPAL deduplicates by part name. Identical part names are mapped to a single OPAL Part, and BOM quantities are accumulated across all references. This prevents duplicate entries for shared components.

**Soft-delete restoration:** If a previously soft-deleted OPAL part reappears in a subsequent Onshape BOM sync, the part's `deleted_at` is cleared and it is restored automatically.

**Part studio mode:** When `element_type` is `"part_studio"`, pull sync fetches the flat parts list from the Onshape parts API instead of the assembly BOM endpoint. Each part is imported with quantity 1 and no BOM lines are created (part studios have no parent-child hierarchy). All other behavior (change detection, link creation, stale marking) works the same.

**How to trigger:**

- **Settings UI**: Click the **PULL** button in the Onshape Integration panel
- **API**: `POST /api/onshape/sync/pull` (optionally with `?document_id=...` to sync one document)
- **Automatic polling**: Runs on the configured interval for documents with `auto_sync: true`
- **Webhook**: Onshape sends a notification, OPAL triggers pull automatically

#### Push Sync (OPAL → Onshape)

Push sync writes OPAL metadata (part numbers, categories, tiers) back to Onshape custom properties.

**What happens:**

1. Queries all non-stale OnshapeLink records for the document
2. For each linked part:
   - Computes a `push_hash` (SHA-256 of internal_pn, category, tier)
   - If the hash matches the last push: skips (no changes)
   - If changed: fetches existing metadata from Onshape, maps OPAL fields to Onshape property IDs using `field_mapping`, and sends the update

**How to trigger:**

- **Settings UI**: Click the **PUSH** button in the Onshape Integration panel
- **API**: `POST /api/onshape/sync/push` (optionally with `?document_id=...`)
- **Automatic**: After a pull sync creates new parts, push runs automatically to sync the new part numbers back to Onshape

#### Automatic Polling

When credentials are configured and `OPAL_ONSHAPE_POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES` is greater than 0, OPAL starts a background polling loop at application startup.

**Behavior:**

1. Sleeps for the configured interval
2. For each registered document with `auto_sync: true`:
   - Runs a pull sync
   - If new parts were created, automatically runs a push sync to write part numbers back
3. Repeats until the application shuts down

Set `OPAL_ONSHAPE_POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES=0` to disable polling entirely.

#### Webhooks (Advanced)

For real-time sync without polling, configure an Onshape webhook to notify OPAL when documents change.

**Prerequisites:**

- OPAL must be reachable from the internet (e.g., via a tunnel or public URL)
- Set `OPAL_ONSHAPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to a shared secret string

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/onshape/webhook`

**Verification:** If `OPAL_ONSHAPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set, OPAL verifies the `X-Onshape-Signature` header using HMAC-SHA256. Requests with invalid signatures are rejected.

**Behavior:** When a webhook fires, OPAL extracts the `documentId` from the payload, matches it to a registered document, and triggers a pull sync.

### Settings UI

Navigate to **Settings** to find the **ONSHAPE INTEGRATION** panel. This panel appears when credentials are configured.

**Panel contents:**

- **Status indicator**: `CONNECTED` (credentials + documents configured) or `CREDENTIALS ONLY` (credentials set but no documents registered)
- **PULL button**: Triggers a pull sync for all registered documents
- **PUSH button**: Triggers a push sync for all registered documents
- **Status table**: Shows connection status and polling interval
- **Registered Documents table**: Lists all documents from `opal.project.yaml` with their name, document ID, element ID, and auto_sync status
- **Add Document form**: Paste an Onshape document URL to register a new document. The element type (assembly or part studio) is auto-detected from the URL. Documents are added to `opal.project.yaml` and appear in the table immediately.
- **Remove button**: Each registered document has a remove button that unregisters it (removes from `opal.project.yaml`)
- **Sync Result**: Shows the result of the last manual sync operation
- **Recent Sync Log**: Table of recent sync operations with timestamps, direction, trigger, status, and counters

### Part Detail

Parts linked to Onshape display a **LINKED** badge on their detail page. The badge links to the Onshape document URL. If the part's Onshape name is available, it is shown next to the link.

If the link is **stale** (the part was removed from the Onshape BOM), a **STALE** warning badge is displayed instead.

The last sync timestamp is shown when available.

### API Reference

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/onshape/status` | Integration status: enabled, connected, registered documents, poll interval |
| `POST` | `/api/onshape/sync/pull` | Trigger pull sync (optional `?document_id=...`) |
| `POST` | `/api/onshape/sync/push` | Trigger push sync (optional `?document_id=...`) |
| `GET` | `/api/onshape/sync/logs` | Recent sync logs (`?limit=20&direction=pull\|push`) |
| `GET` | `/api/onshape/links` | List Onshape-linked parts (`?document_id=...&stale=true\|false`) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/onshape/links/{link_id}` | Unlink a part from Onshape (does not delete the OPAL part) |
| `POST` | `/api/onshape/documents` | Register a document from an Onshape URL (auto-detects element type) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/onshape/documents/{did}/{eid}` | Remove a registered document |
| `POST` | `/api/onshape/webhook` | Onshape webhook receiver (HMAC-verified if secret configured) |

### Troubleshooting

**Sync fails with authentication errors:**
Verify `OPAL_ONSHAPE_ACCESS_KEY` and `OPAL_ONSHAPE_SECRET_KEY` are correct. Regenerate the API key pair in the Onshape Developer Portal if needed.

**Sync returns no parts:**
Check that `document_id` and `element_id` in `opal.project.yaml` are correct. Open the Onshape document in a browser and verify the URL matches. If `workspace_id` is empty, ensure the document has a default workspace.

**Rate limiting (429 errors):**
The Onshape client retries automatically with exponential backoff (respects `Retry-After` headers). If rate limiting persists, increase `OPAL_ONSHAPE_POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES` or reduce the number of registered documents.

**Stale links:**
A link becomes stale when the part is removed from the Onshape BOM. The OPAL part is not deleted — only the link is marked stale. To clean up, unlink the part via `DELETE /api/onshape/links/{link_id}` or re-add the part in Onshape and run another pull sync.

**Checking sync history:**
View the sync log table in **Settings → Onshape Integration** or query `GET /api/onshape/sync/logs`. Each entry shows direction, trigger, status, and counters for parts and BOM lines created/updated/removed.

## Traceability & Compliance

### Why Traceability Matters

For hardware projects, especially in aerospace, medical, or safety-critical domains, you must answer:

1. **What went into this assembly?** (Forward traceability)
2. **Where did this component end up?** (Reverse traceability)
3. **Who built it, when, and how?** (Process traceability)
4. **What tests were performed?** (Quality traceability)
5. **What problems occurred?** (Non-conformance traceability)

OPAL provides complete traceability through:
- OPAL numbers (unique IDs)
- Work Order numbers (execution tracking)
- Genealogy (component → assembly relationships)
- Audit logs (complete change history)

```

### Compliance Reporting

For audits or certifications, OPAL can generate reports showing:

1. **Part Traceability Matrix**: Every part with sources and uses
2. **Procedure Compliance**: All executions with sign-offs
3. **Test Results Summary**: Pass/fail rates by part or procedure
4. **Change History**: Complete audit log for any date range
5. **Non-Conformance Log**: All issues with resolutions

**Export formats**:
- CSV for data analysis
- PDF for documentation packages (future)
- JSON for integration with other systems

### Best Practices for Traceability

1. **Always assign OPAL numbers**: Never use parts without inventory records
2. **Capture data at every step**: More data = better traceability
3. **Log all NCs immediately**: Don't wait until end of day
4. **Use lot numbers**: Especially for critical components
5. **Sign off parent OPs**: Ensures review happened
6. **Regular audits**: Spot-check traceability chains monthly
7. **Backup database**: OPAL is your compliance record - back up `data/opal.db` daily

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Kit not available" when starting execution

**Cause**: Required parts aren't in stock.

**Solution**:
1. Check kit requirements on procedure detail page
2. View current stock levels for each part
3. If stock exists but at wrong location, transfer it
4. If out of stock, create a purchase order
5. Alternatively, consume from other OPAL numbers if acceptable

#### Issue: Cannot complete step - "Data validation failed"

**Cause**: Captured data doesn't match the required schema.

**Solution**:
1. Check the step's required data schema
2. Ensure all required fields are filled
3. Ensure numeric values are within min/max ranges
4. Ensure correct data types (number vs text)
5. If schema is wrong, update the master procedure and publish a new version (future executions will use the fix)

#### Issue: OPAL number not found

**Cause**: Typo or the inventory record was deleted.

**Solution**:
1. Check the exact OPAL number format (OPAL-00001, not OPAL-1)
2. Search inventory by part instead
3. Check audit logs to see if it was deleted or consumed
4. If consumed, view consumption record to see which execution used it

#### Issue: Version content doesn't match master procedure

**Cause**: Editing the master doesn't affect published versions.

**Solution**:
This is intentional! Published versions are immutable. To update:
1. Edit the master procedure
2. Publish a new version
3. New executions will use the new version
4. Old executions continue using their locked version (preserving traceability)

#### Issue: Server won't start - "Database locked"

**Cause**: Another OPAL process is running, or a previous process didn't shut down cleanly.

**Solution**:
1. Check for other `opal serve` processes: `ps aux | grep opal`
2. Kill any hung processes: `kill <PID>`
3. If persists, check file permissions on `data/opal.db`
4. Worst case: restart your computer

#### Issue: Changes not showing up in UI

**Cause**: Browser cache or HTMX not refreshing.

**Solution**:
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)

#### Issue: Dropdown menus not working

**Cause**: CSS not loaded or JavaScript disabled.

**Solution**:
1. Hard refresh the page
2. Check that `/static/css/main.css` is loading (Network tab in browser dev tools)
3. Ensure browser has CSS hover support
4. Try a different browser
